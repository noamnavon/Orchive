              <p class="lyrics">The sigh of summer upon my return
                Fifteen alike since I was here
                Bathed in deep fog, blurring my trail
                Snuffing the first morning rays
                
                Weary from what might have been ages
                Still calm with my mind at peace
                Would I prosper or fall, drain the past
                The lapse of the moment took it's turn
                
                I was foul and tainted, devoid of faith
                Wearing my death-mask at birth
                The hands of God, decrepit and thin
                Cold caress and then nothing
                I was taken away from my plight
                A treason bestowed to the crowd
                Branded a Jonah with fevered blood
                Ungodly freak, defiler
                
                Pale touch, writhing in the embers
                Damp mud burning in my eyes
                All the faces turned away
                And all would sneer at my demise
                
                Outcast with dogmas forged below
                Seared and beaten, banished from where I was born
                No mercy would help me on my way
                In the pouring rain nothing is the same
                
                Vows in ashes
                I pledge myself to no-one
                Seethed and spiteful
                All shudder at the call of my name
                If you'll bear with me
                You'll fear of me
                
                There is no forgiveness in these eyes
                For any of you but one
                Dispel the mist for now
                Melinda is the reason why I've come
                
                She is water drops over the pyre
                A thistle in my hands
                Stained and torn, aged and brown
                Virtuous shell with kindred innocence
                
                I awoke from the miasma
                Passing swiftly through the moor
                This is here, waters stir
                And in the distance all that was lost
                If you'll bear with me
                You'll fear of me
                You'd never leave me to
                A fate with you
              </p>

          </div>

        <p>The story unfolds with fifteen years of solitude on the moor, endured by the outcast after being ostracized from his fervently religious indextown for his lack of faith. 
          Upon his return, he seeks out his lost love, Melinda.

                Staining the soil, midst of stillness
                Beloved fraternity to an end
                Red eyes probe the scene
                All the same
                Stilted for the beholder
                Depravity from the core
                Handcarved death in stoneladen aisles
                
                I hide the scars from my past
                Yet they sense my (mute) dirge
                This is when it all falls apart
                White hands grasping for straws
                
                Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
                Undisguised manmade nova
                Mute cry, don't dare to tread
                Searing beams tracking you down
                
                Adoring what never has been
                Some will bring with them all they have seen
                
                Searching my way to perplexion
                The gleam of her eyes
                In that moment she knew
                
                Thought I could not leave this place
                On this imminent day
                As I've reached the final dawn
                To what's gone astray
                What would they care if I did stay
                No-one would know
                What would they care if I did stay
                No-one should know
                
                Thought I could not leave this place

                Still brooding, soothing calm
                That rigid, twisted face
                Blank godhead, tear my name
                Lost virtue, frantic lust
                
                Sly smile, poisoned glare behind
                Undisguised manmade nova

                Searching my way to perplexion
                In crumbling faith I saw her
                Bearing her pain in the wilderness
                The gleam of her eyes

        <p>Their reunion is silent but profound, her recognition clear in the gleam of her eyes.

                So far away

                Come into this night
                When days are done
                Lost and astray
                In what's vanished from your eyes
                
                What came and distorted your sight
                Saw you benighted by your fright

                Your plight alone
                Carry your weight
                You are flawed as all of us
                Come into this night
                Your only home
                It's never too late
                To repent, suffer the loss

                Come into this night
                When you're able
                To undo your deeds
                And atone with your lonely soul
                Once you're into this night
                All minds are stable
                Forget all your needs
                Lose the grip of all control

                Lost sight of everything tonight
                My presence blackens their pattern
                A pock in the healthy and calm
                
                Their scorn behind your back
                My promise would put them down
                No trace of reverence left
                Immemorial fire in their eyes
                
                I would perish at the given signal
                At the slightest touch from my soul
                Tainted prophet in flesh
                For all the plagued and lost
                
                Dripping sin
                Decision in stalemate
                Dare to feel death at hand
                Surprised me with its voice
                Through the forest came the morn
                
                Across the leafy pathway
                Their deeds smeared in blood
                For all to behold
                The council of the cross
                Must have sensed my coming
                The pest through the air
                With despise for squalor
                Lashing out at the poor
                
                I turned away my eyes
                In pallor escape from the end
                Fading time to leave from here
                And less to fulfill my task
                She would be safe and firm
                Nothing of this is in vain
                Taken away from stifling grace
                And saved from the past

                No joy would flicker in her eyes
                Brooding sadness came to a rise
                
                Words would falter to atone
                Failure had passed the stepping stone
                She had sworn her vows to another
                This is when no-one will bother
                
                And conceded pain in crumbling mirth
                A harlot of God upon the earth
                Found where she sacrificed her ways
                That hollow love in her face
                
                Still I plotted to have her back
                The contentment that would fill the crack
                My soul released a fluttering sigh
                This day fell, the darkness nigh
                
                I took her by the hand to say
                All faith forever has been washed away
                I returned for you in great dismay
                Come with me, far away to stay
                
                Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime
                She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme
                But baffled herself with the final line
                My promise is made but my heart is thine

        <p>As she recounts the events during his absence, he discovers she was wed to a man of faith, though doubts linger about her consent to this union. Together, they share a night.

                Black paragon in lingering breath
                
                White faced, haggard grin
                This serenity painted death
                With a halo of bitter disease
                Black paragon in lingering breath
                
                Saw her fading, blank stare into me
                Clenched fist from the beautiful pain
                
                Darkness reared its head
                Tearing within the reeling haze
                Took control, claiming my flesh
                Piercing rage, perfect tantrum
                Each and every one would die at my hand
                Choking in warm ponds of blood
                At last, weak and torn, I went down
                Drained from strength, flickering breath
                
                Came with the moon
                The wayward in conscious state
                Flanked and barred in destiny's end
                Underneath with hope in latches
                Swathed in filth, any would betoken
                Starlit shadows on the wall
                Finally there to collect me
                From the bowels of sin

        <p>Come morning, he finds himself alone. His search ends in horror when he discovers Melinda's lifeless body, victim to the village's vengeance for her perceived betrayal.
          The fifteen years of waiting have gone to waste, and with this incomprehensible notion, he gets insane. What he describes as a “beautiful pain” soon turns into a tantrum, and he starts killing anyone he sees.
          Fatigue overtakes him by nightfall; he collapses, and the church's followers apprehend him. Notably, in this sixth track, the music ceases abruptly, signaling his loss of consciousness.

              <p class="lyrics">Still it came passing by
                The pieces weaved together rose the sun
                And fooled me with another day
                The knocking message called for my life
                
                Sealed the spell of my scrawny body
                Soil to skin, my next of kin
                Damp air grasped, stole the words
                And greeted me with a hiss
                
                This is forgiveness, so I know
                Once I repent I seal the lid
                I slither for you and I'm dying
                I find trust in hate
                
                They wear white for me
                Seemingly jaded and lost
                I forge myself into your dreams
                And here I am your life
                
                Hangman, clutching at his tools
                I will come for you
                
                The noose is tied
                Murmur through the crowd
                Plunging into anywhere but here
                
                Cloak-captured sighs of relief
                As the primal touch brought me back
                And the last sight I did see is still here
                Beckoning right behind me
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Dawn of the final day presents a grim tableau: an execution. Confronted with the noose and executioner, the gathered crowd in their white garb embodies a hollow sanctity.
          In these final moments, the outcast harbors only hate and apathy, his last utterance a chilling promise: “I will come for you.”
          The crowd's discomfort is palpable; they carry out their duty not with zeal, but with a sense of weary obligation. 
          This dissonance, this feigned morality, stands as a potent theme throughout the album—evil does not proclaim itself but masquerades behind acts justified as serving some grander good.
          Thus, the antagonist meets his end, hanged by a community cloaked in holiness.
          As his life ebbs away, so too does the music, both fading to silence.

        <h3 class="para-title">Paradox</h3>
        <p>'Still Life' is aptly titled, presenting a sharp dichotomy between societal virtues and the underlying malevolence it often masks. 
          Through the eyes of the narrator being vilified by a pious society, Opeth critiques the hypocrisy inherent within. The album reflects this sentiment through:
          <ul>
            <li>'The Moor,' with the oxymoronic lyric “Still calm with my mind at peace” amidst chaos.</li>
            <li>'Godhead's Lament,' ironically named given its focus on the sorrow of a coerced atheist.</li>
            <li>In 'Benighted,' the album's most romantic song, the lyrics 'you are flawed as all of us' starkly contrast with the song's intimate tone. Additionally, the phrase 'Atone with your lonely soul' strikes a dissonant chord, as it contradicts the narrator's atheistic convictions.</li>
            <li>'Serenity Painted Death,' paradoxically named as it explores the 'beautiful pain' surrounding death.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 class="para-title">Guilt</h3>
        <p>The album delves into the burden of guilt. 
          A man, essentially good and yearning for simple love and peace, is demonized and exiled. 
          It's suggested that he might have thrived in a secular environment, but the rigid dogma of his village condemns him. This external judgment is internalized, as the narrator sees himself as a defiler. 
          These settings lead to self-destruction and madness, which in turn results in actual inhumane deeds.

        <h3 class="para-title">Sound</h3>
        <p>The sound of the album is rich and layered. Opeth deliberately avoided using digital instruments, quantization, harmonizers, or pitch correction tools. The principal list of instruments includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Electric Guitar</li>
            <li>Acoustic Guitar</li>
            <li>Bass Guitar</li>
            <li>Drums</li>
            <li>Vocals</li>
          </ul> <br>
          Despite this seemingly minimalist setup, the sophisticated use of effects and layering positions this album as one of the most sonically rich in metal history. 
          <br>It's worth paying special attention to the reverb, particularly on the snare drum, to appreciate its quality.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="para-title">Genre</h3>
        <p>Broadly speaking, this album stands out as a formidable Death Metal work, aligning seamlessly with the narrative's intensity. 
          Yet, delving into details reveals surprising combinations. 
          Ambient passages contribute mood and atmosphere throughout the album. 
          There's also an abundance of ballads and folk influences. 
          The vocalist's range spans from gentle, melodious singing to soulful deep growls. 
          However, the pervasive sense of darkness remains constant; there are no departures into lighter moods.
        </p>

        <h3 class="para-title">Visuals</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://www.seempieces.com" class="site">Travis Smith</a> is the renowned artist behind both the original and remixed album artworks, celebrated in the Metal music scene for his evocative, dark-themed paintings. 
          The album's visuals, crucial to its narrative, adopt a monochromatic scheme portraying bleak scenes, with a red tone symbolizing thrill, rage, and violence. 
          These images, while not excessively grotesque, are sufficiently somber to match the album's intense musicality.
