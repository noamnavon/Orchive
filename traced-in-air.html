            <br>We're eternal Nunc Stans soldiers
            <br>The eternal warriors
            <br>
            <br>We're accountants in the firm of life
            <br>Entrusted with a body, heart and mind
            <br>Hey comrade, did I love well?
            <br>Have I learned to live moment to moment?
            <br>
            <br>We don't own our work
            <br>We don't own the Earth
            <br>We don't own our minds
            <br>We don't own anything at all
            <br>
            <br>We're eternal Nunc Stans soldiers
            <br>The eternal warriors
            <br>
            <br>It was not death
            <br>It was not life
            <br>It was love...

        <p>
          The sound of the album is rich and layered. Opeth deliberately avoided using digital instruments, quantization, harmonizers, or pitch correction tools. The principal list of instruments includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Electric Guitar</li>
            <li>Acoustic Guitar</li>
            <li>Bass Guitar</li>
            <li>Drums</li>
            <li>Vocals</li>
          </ul> <br>
          Despite this seemingly minimalist setup, the sophisticated use of effects and layering positions this album as one of the most sonically rich in metal history. 
          <br>It's worth paying special attention to the reverb, particularly on the snare drum, to appreciate its quality.

          Broadly speaking, this album stands out as a formidable Death Metal work, aligning seamlessly with the narrative's intensity. 
          Yet, delving into details reveals surprising combinations. 
          Ambient passages contribute mood and atmosphere throughout the album. 
          There's also an abundance of ballads and folk influences. 
          The vocalist's range spans from gentle, melodious singing to soulful deep growls. 
          However, the pervasive sense of darkness remains constant; there are no departures into lighter moods.
